Exploratory Data Analysis on Airline Customer Reviews

Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 20k+ customer reviews scraped from Skytrax, covering global airlines.

Conducted data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, parsing dates, feature engineering from review text and flight details).

Analyzed customer satisfaction trends across features such as traveler type, service class, route, and subscores (food, seat comfort, cabin service, etc.).

Built visual analytics dashboards (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to compare airlines, identify service gaps, and highlight key drivers of positive/negative recommendations.

Derived business insights such as how traveler type and service class influence overall scores, and which service aspects (e.g., cabin service, value for money) most strongly correlate with recommendations.

Prepared the dataset for potential downstream tasks like sentiment analysis and predictive modeling of airline recommendation likelihood.
